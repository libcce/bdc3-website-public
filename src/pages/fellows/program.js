                    The NHLBI BioData Catalyst Fellows Program provides early-career researchers (graduate students, postdocs, junior faculty, and others)
                    the opportunity to receive funding to help support research on novel and innovative data science and data-focused research problems.
                    The program is open to academic disciplines conducting biomedical research, particularly in heart, lung, blood, and sleep (HLBS) domains,
                    which may or may not include the impact of Coronavirus (COVID-19) in those domains. 
                </Paragraph>
        
                <Paragraph>
                    The vision for the BioData Catalyst is to be a community-driven ecosystem implementing data science solutions, democratizing data and computational access,
                    extending services such as TOPMed and dbGaP, and advancing HLBS science. The BioData Catalyst Fellows Program offers a mechanism for
                    early career researchers to engage with the Consortium as partners in the BioData Catalyst endeavor.

                    Preference will be given to proposals that leverage the strengths of the ecosystem to enable cutting edge research and also test the capabilities of the ecosystem.
                    Consideration will be given to early-career applicants (graduate students, postdocs, junior faculty, and others), especially those who will bring diversity to the BioData Catalyst community.

                <Paragraph>
                    The Cohort 2 fellowship funding period will run 12 months, from September 2020 to September 2021, with a brief project report due six months into the project (February 2021) and a final report due at the end (September 2021).
                    All Fellows will be expected to be involved in NHLBI BioData Catalyst activities during the year, including attending quarterly consortium meetings and participating in monthly Fellows meetings.
                    Fellows will also be encouraged to make their workflows and tools more widely available within the ecosystem and the broader research community and to welcome and help onboard new users to the community.

                    Awardees will receive a stipend of up to $69,733, which includes costs for salary, travel, training, publication, and conference fees.
                    As part of the Uniform Guidance, fellowships are not subject to indirect costs, and these should not be budgeted.
                    Reasonable cloud costs will be covered by NHLBI and should not be included in your budget.
