    title: Whole Genome-Sequencing Analyses of Imaging Phenotypes of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)
    abstract: >
        COPD is diagnosed by spirometry, but underlying these changes are structural abnormalities that can be identified using computed tomography (CT) imaging. Detailed analysis of these imaging endotypes has not been performed. Here, I propose to conduct whole-genome sequencing (WGS) analyses on existing and newly generated imaging phenotypes related to COPD on the BioData Catalyst platform. I will work with the platform developers to ensure that programs for image and WGS analyses are run smoothly and are available as templates for future investigations. I will also serve as key contact to allow TOPMed respiratory investigators to take advantage of this platform.
bio: Dandi Qiao is currently an instructor in Medicine at the Channing Division of Network Medicine in the Harvard Medical School and a genetic epidemiologist at the Brigham and Women’s Hospital. Qiao received her Bachelor of Mathematics from the University of Waterloo and her PhD from the Department of Biostatistics at the Harvard School of Public Health. Her research interest is in the development of statistical methods and their applications for identifying genetic factors for human diseases, with a focus in Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). Qiao’s recent research topic is developing statistical tools for next-generation sequencing data and applying them to identify rare variants associated with disease susceptibility.
