    title: CT-Based Pulmonary Hypertension Phenotyping in Smokers Using Artificial Intelligence 
    abstract: >
        In this study, we will develop innovative tools for objective measurement of pulmonary vasculature morphology in smokers using computed tomographic (CT) imaging to characterize pulmonary hypertension (PH) disease severity.
        Many smokers receive CT imaging for lung cancer screening and diagnosis of lung disease. Our goal is to develop algorithms that help define the main structural effects of PH in COPD patients. We will leverage the BioData-Catalyst platform to refine our approaches, provide better imaging artery-vein detection, and develop novel deep-learning approaches for vessel wall quantification. Our methods will be incorporated in Chest Imaging Platform and BioData-Catalyst and use COPDGene data.
bio: Pietro Nardelli holds a PhD in Electric and Electronic Engineering received from the University College Cork, Ireland, where he was the original developer and designer of an innovative open source approach for virtual bronchoscopy starting from CT images. Since 2016, he has been a member of the Applied Chest Imaging Laboratory at Brigham and Womenâ€™s Hospital and an instructor in Radiology at Harvard Medical School. Nardelli has a broad background in biomedical engineering, with specific training and expertise in medical image analysis and artificial intelligence applied to medicine. The goal of his research program is the design and development of new algorithms in the field of image-based biomarkers for the understanding of lung diseases, with particular interest in Pulmonary Vascular Disease (PVD). As part of his research, Nardelli leads several artificial intelligence projects at the Applied Chest Imaging Laboratory (ACIL), where he develops and applies new machine learning approaches for advanced image-based lung phenotyping problems. He also contributes to the development, integration, and validation of new algorithms into the open source software Chest Imaging Platform (CIP), and he is a member of the COPDGene imaging core group.
