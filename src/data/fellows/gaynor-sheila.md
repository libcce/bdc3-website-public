    title: Scalable Statistical and Computational Methods for Integrating Functional Data in Rare Variant Analysis of Large Whole Genome Sequencing Data
    abstract: >
        I will advance my expertise in the BioData Catalyst ecosystem by developing a workflow for rare variant (RV) analysis incorporating functional annotations and applying it to TOPMed WGS data. I will implement the variant-Set Test for Association using Annotation infoRmation (STAAR) method [1] for RV analysis on Terra in collaboration with BioData Catalyst and Terra developers. I will apply the workflow to analyze pulmonary and glycemic traits in collaboration with TOPMed working groups under approved, in progress proposals to accelerate RV discovery. I will champion use of the BioData Catalyst ecosystem, including the new functionality offered by the STAAR workflow.
bio: Sheila Gaynor is  a postdoctoral research fellow in the Biostatistics department at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, working with Dr. Xihong Lin. Her research focuses on integrative statistical genetic and genomics, network analysis, high performance computing, and computational biology. Gaynor is highly engaged in the TOPMed program, where she is leading analyses on rare variants and functional characterization of trait-associated variants. She completed her PhD in Biostatistics at Harvard University in 2018 with a focus on methods in computational biology and multi-omics.
